## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Context
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

Firstly I have watched Kevin Powell course on Scrimba. After that, I tried to rebuild the whole page from scratch using React. For most problems, I had to recreate Indicators but with little help, I managed to solve this issue.
Building this project showed how to work with utility classes in CSS and show how they might be useful.
Additionally, I have learned in which situation grid and flex might be used together.

I learn HTML picture tags and when they might be used
```html
<picture>
  <source srcSet={images.webp} type="image/webp" />
  <img src={images.png} alt={name} />
</picture>
```
Also how to prepare a site to be used with assistive technology and purpose to create Skip To Content Button.


### Continued development

I wasn't able to create content swtich by keyboard
